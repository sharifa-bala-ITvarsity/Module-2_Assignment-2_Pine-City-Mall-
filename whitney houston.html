                    <h3>WHITNEY HOUSTON The Concert for a NEW South Africa</h3>
                    <p>In 1994, Whitney Houston took the stage in Durban, South Africa, making her the first major Western musician to visit the newly unified, post-apartheid nation following President Nelson Mandela’s winning election. This performance was more than a concert; it was a celebration of freedom, hope, and unity. Whitney’s powerhouse voice and emotional delivery brought joy and inspiration to a country newly liberated. Now, 30 years after the historic visit, The Concert for a New South Africa (Durban) comes to the big screen for the first time. Digitally remastered in 4K and featuring newly-enhanced audio, the film captures every note, every cheer, every tear, immortalizing a night that transcended music and became a beacon of change and celebration </p>
